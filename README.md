## Description of Features
Dot Product: There is a glowing orb. When you look at it, it turns white. When you look away from it, it turns red.

LERP: The glowing orb uses a lerp to go back and fourth between two waypoints.

Particle Effect: When the character approaches the big hallway halfway through the level, ground fog appears.

Sound Effect: As the character approaches the ghosts, ambient music gets quiter and a heart beat sound effect plays. It gets faster as the character gets closer.
